    <h1>Mojito</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/mojito.jpeg" alt="Mojito" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
    <p>The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe known around the world. The
        origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. Named for Sir
        Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of
        aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal
        purposes, but it is easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects.</p>
